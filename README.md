# rover-test

##Dependancies
ruby 1.9
ruby gems
gem install circular_list

## How to run

Either:

ruby martian_robots.rb input_text

or

ruby martian_robots.rb < input_file.txt

## Notes:

Most of the core logic is in class robot.rb

Lacks validation, but is fairly robust to nasty input due to regexs etc

doesn't account for robot collisions
